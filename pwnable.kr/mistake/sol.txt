if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){

The above line in mistake.c does not properly use order of operations.

If the file is opened, open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0
becomes 0, since it was successful, and fd is now 0.

0 is stdin, so the password is actually being read in from stdin

So we need a 10 character string to be our password, and then we need to xor it.

Fortunately, the author GAVE us code to xor a string... we can just use that!

I created a short program, xor.c, that xors a string given to argv, 
using the code in mistake.c

For keviniscoo, we get back: jdwhohrbnn

So, just pipe jdwhohrbnnkeviniscoo to the program
