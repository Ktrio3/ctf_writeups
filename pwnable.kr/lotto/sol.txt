In the code, you will find the following loop:

// calculate lotto score
int match = 0, j = 0;
for(i=0; i<6; i++){
	for(j=0; j<6; j++){
		if(lotto[i] == submit[j]){
			match++;
		}
	}
}

This loop will check if a byte is the same as another byte, in any order.

For example, if lotto is abcde and submit is aaaaaa, each a will match the first a.

Just keep entering the same character until you win! Something with ascii code below 45, like !!!!!!

I tried this challenge 3 times, and won after 3, 4, and 4 attempts, so it shouldn't take long.
