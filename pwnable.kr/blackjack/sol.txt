Based on the size of the file, the initial thought is that this will
be a more complex challenge than previously, and require some kind of
code injection.

However, looking over the code base, you will come across:

		int betting() //Asks user amount to bet
		{
		 printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
		 scanf("%d", &bet);

		 if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
		 {
			printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
			printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
			scanf("%d", &bet);
			return bet;
		 }
		 else return bet;
		} // End Function

Notice that this function checks that you don't bet more cash then you have...

BUT it doesn't check that you bet over $0

So, our bet will then be -1,000,000 to get us our prize.

But we want to GAIN money, not lose it.

		void stay()
		{
			...
			if(player_total<dealer_total) //If player's total is less than dealer's total, loss
			{
				 printf("\nDealer Has the Better Hand. You Lose.\n");
				 loss = loss+1;
				 cash = cash - bet;
				 printf("\nYou have %d Wins and %d Losses. Awesome!\n", won, loss);
				 dealer_total=0;
				 askover();
			}
			...
		}

Notice that when we lose, our bet is subtracted from our cash.

Thus, to get our one million dollars, we just have to bet negative, and lose!

Just stay when your card is dealt. If you win, just try again.

The flag appears once a new game is played with $1000000.
